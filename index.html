            <h3>About Me</h3>

            <p>I grew up on the Navajo Reservation in northeastern Arizona
                untill the ninth grade. I then went to school for my freshman
                and sophomore years in Massachusetts. Then I finished high
                school at Holbrook high school back in Arizona. I enrolled at
                Arizona State University my freshman year and then moved to
                Flagstaff where I took more courses. I eventually moved to Mesa
                and finished up at ASU with a degree in geography. I then went
                on to work for 21 years with the US Geological Survey in both
                Flagstaff and Tucson. I did some front and back-end web development
                in support of the National Geologic Map Database while working as
                a member of a team. We used a lot of open-source software and I 
                pretty much got by with a VI editor to make code and relied on 
                my web browser to fix bugs. Eventually I left the Survey and
                figured I could do so much more in web development if I were to 
                be exposed to the proper tools and make a dedicated attempt to learn.
